--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8.8: Released: 14-08-2014

- Fixed a couple of issues that - under certain circumstances - could
disrupt the installation process.

- New option to limit total number of outstanding/queued tracks for 
ALL users (applies only to "jukebox mode"). 
So far, this was a setting related to each user. It still exists.

- Added additional/new fingerprint parameters from The Echonest.
Seems like these have been around for some time...
..."thanks" for keeping us updated, Echonest!
The new parameters introduced are: liveness, speechiness, acousticness
and valence.

- Add new music found during scan+import to a specific favorite list.
This option will - if checked (and it is by default) - add all new
music found during scan+import to a specific favorite list.
An additional option makes it possible to add the new music
to a favorite list covering all users.

- Last.fm apparently made a decision to change the way performer/artist
images are retrieved using the last.fm API.
I've changed the code on "my side" of the API accordingly.

- GetID3() latest/newest version.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8.7: Released: September 30th, 2013.

- "Keep open" on pop-up.
...used when selecting a favorite list to add something to.
It's possible to add to several favorite lists in one "go".

- Update: Echonest API.
Identification of tracks is now being done using a "2 step" method:
First, the track is uploaded, then identified. Until recently it was enough
to upload the track, and the track's "fingerprint" would be returned almost
immediately.
I missed that (missing) memo, Echonest!!

- New feature: You might also like...
When a user clicks on "Add to favorite...", a window pops up prompting for
the name of the list to add the track to.
If access to the Echonest API is enabled, some suggestions for similar 
tracks will appear below the prompt.
See screenshot.

- Advanced search: New or old method.
Using advanced search can now be done using parameters (limits) retrieved
and stored from the Echonest API.
For example, an advanced search could be done using "danceability">0.7 and
"tempo">140. The possibilities are quite overwhelming...
This - of course - requires access to the Echoest API as well as proper
"fingerprinting" (identification) of a majority of the tracks in your
collection. 
It's still possible to use the old advanced search functionality.

- Last.fm API-key inconsistency.
Embarassing, but true: I've been using TWO API-keys from Last.fm.
One of them was for testing purposes, and has now expired.
I've made sure that from now on, only ONE key is used against the
last.fm API: The right one! Sorry for the inconvenience.

- ...plus: Better "look&feel".
For example: Tooltips are now much better compared to earlier.
For example, do a "mouseover" on an album and see for yourself :)

- Bonus: A *LOT* of small improvements here&there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8.6: Released: August 7th, 2012.

- Related tracks: Echonest.
One year ago I stumbled across an extremely interesting API.
It basically gives you the option to "identify" each and every 
track within your music library. The identification is based on the
API available from Echonest (http://the.echonest.com). I have coded against
the API in order to use this exciting feature in AmpJuke.
So - start "identifying" your music in AmpJuke, - I will (almost) guarantee
this: It will take the listening experience to a whole new level!
More info. the FAQ: http://www.ampjuke.org/?id=faq87.

- Jukebox mode.
Until this release, AmpJuke have been operating like a personal streaming
service for all registered users (and even anonymous users, if you wish that).
In other words: Each user completely controlled what's being played during
his/her listening session.
With the introduction of the jukebox mode in AmpJuke, listening to music 
can now be done in a manner similar to what is experienced with a 
jukebox (or radio station): ALL users listens to the same music.
If this sounds interesting, start here: http://www.ampjuke.org/?id=faq93

- Screensaver (sort of).
A simple "screensaver" is introduced in this release of AmpJuke.
There's a small background-story about why I did this.
Read more about it here: http://www.ampjuke.org/?id=faq98

- Alternative scan+music management.
By Marc Apgar - THANKS!
You will find this new feature/tool in the admin panel on the left side
on the "Welcome" page.
The tool is included "as is" as I haven't really had the time to look
close into it. Marc mentioned something about additional documentation
in an email. Should he decide to do that, I'll post it on the
webiste.

- Bye bye Bing!
Recently, Microsoft decided to (almost) pull the plug on free usage
of the API in relation to Bing!
Free access to search results are now almost non-existing, to stay
free API-calls should be kept below 5000. PER MONTH!! 
Unless - of course - you want to pay...
...guess M$ is of the impression that that's a great offer.
I don't think so. 
To do bulk and individual retrievel of album and performer images, a switch
has been made to Google. We all know that M$ has been suspected for 
"borrowing" some of Google's results in the past...

- A lot of small improvements here&there. Really.
I won't outline all of them here.
If you're curious, just do a "grep 0.8.6 *.php" within the folder
where AmpJuke is installed (assuming you run it on Unix/Linux).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8.5: Released: July 31st, 2011.

- New feature: Edit tags on files.
It is possible to enable editing right away when an error/warning is
encoutered after scan+import has completed.
Besides editing tags right after scan+import, it's also possible to do it
later on
More in the FAQ: http://www.ampjuke.org/?id=faq35

- Information: AmpJuke uses GetID3 version 1.9 (http://www.getid3.org).
It's the newest.

- Introduced: jQuery. 
AmpJuke have started to make use of the wildly popular jQuery framework. 
See for yourself :)
More in the FAQ: http://www.ampjuke.org/?id=faq86

- Random play improved: Added two extra options when setting up random
play: The first makes it possible to limit the total duration of tracks
selected for being played. The other deals with avoiding seletion 
of tracks played within a specific amount of days.
More in the FAQ.

- Improvement: When playing tracks by random after the last track
selected by the user has been played, AmpJuke attempts to avoid
a "circular trap".
More in the FAQ: http://www.ampjuke.org/?id=faq30

- Italian language updated.
By Pietro "Maerlin" Baiguini. THANKS. 
It's highly appreciated.

- Danish language updated.
By some strange fellow named Michael H. Iversen... :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8.4: Released: December 18th, 2010.

- New feature: Self registration.
It's been on the to-do list for quite a while.
From now on, it is possible to enable self-registration of users within
AmpJuke. Cool...

- New personal setting: Hide text next to icons.
Save some screen real estate.
Hiding the text after the icons scattered around the various options is now
possible. It's a personal setting.
The text in the main menu to the left will still be visible.

- New feature: IE9 jumplists.
Frankly, I'm quite impressed with the Windows 7 / Internet Explorer 9 combo.
So if you're lucky enough to get your hands on a PC with Win 7 and IE9, you
might as well take advantage of the jumplists in AmpJuke.
In other words: AmpJuke uses a jumplist-launcher when a user is 
running Win7 with IE9.
Pure eyecandy that might impress your friends and family :-)

- German translation updated.
Thanks to Benjamin Preuß (r2k) for supplying this in the forum.

- Improvement: If an album cover isn't downloaded+stored correctly then
the cover will be hard (impossible) to see later.
From now on, the routine that auto-downloads covers will check if the
size of the image is above a "certain size" (10 bytes).
If not, the default/blank AmpJuke cover will be used instead.
Thanks to Ben for suggesting this in the forum.

- Error correction: Clicking on "Play all..." when displaying a specific
favorite list didn't have any effect (ie. the music wasn't streaming).
That is no longer the case.

- Modified: The function split() has been deprecated since PHP version 5.3.0.
I've changed the code where split() is used and is now using explode() instead.
THANKS to all of you 'out there' who notified about it in the forum.

- Cleaned: Some themes was "broken" (not rendered as expected in the browser).
Although this is "just" an improvement, it required some work *everywhere*.
Anyway, "broken" layouts should be history now (I hope...).

- Fixed: When replacing a picture of an artist (performer) and/or replacing an
image for an album using an URL, nothing happened.
This is no longer the case. 

- Adjusted: Changed the order of items in the XSPF-playlists generated by
AmpJuke. I'm not usre why, but suddenly the flash player within AmpJuke
started to act strange. I've changed the way XSPF-playlists are generated
so the XSPF-playlists in AmpJuke is according to the standard.

- Cleaned up in some of the code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8.3: Released: August 13th, 2010.

- Fixed: Security issue.
A specific URL-parameter was not properly sanitized before being 
used in SQL queries. 
This is no longer the case.

- Fixed: Upgrade issue.
If you plan to upgrade to this version, please MAKE SURE that you're running
AmpJuke version 0.8.0 or above.
If not, I highly recommend a fresh installation.

- New feature: Use URL when replacing image for an album or artist.
If you're unhappy with the images returned ans suggested by the API from
either last.fm and/or Bing, you can type in an URL that points to an
image you want to use to represent the album or artist.
THANKS to jesperts for coding this simple,clean and efficient modification.

- New theme: Bright Theme.
Made by Eigan.no.
Thanks! Looks extremely great!

- New set of icons: Spirit20 by Dale Morrell.
You can find the entire set here: http://19eighty7.com

- New set of icons: Crystal Project by Everaldo Coelho.
You can find the entire set here: http://www.everaldo.com

- New personal setting: Create favorite lists automatically.
This new setting is related to the functionality introduced in 0.8.2.
It turned out that having just "Add tracks to favorite lists automatically" as
the only option to automatically add something to a favorite list (existing
or new) was a little overwhelming (ie. a *lot* of favorite lists were created).
The personal setting "Create favorite lists automatically" does - as the name
indicates - only create *new* favorite lists if this setting is activated.
If "Create new favorite lists automatically" isn't activated, then tracks 
will only be added to a given favorite list if the name of the favorite
list exists already.
More in the FAQ.

- Error correction: When trying to 'un-share' a shared favorite list, an
error was shown. This is no longe the case.

- Error correction: Anonymous users could not stream music.
This is no longer the case.
THANKS to dontaco2000 for notifying about this in the forum.

- New theme: Big blue.
Made by me :-)
Mainly for fairly large monitors.
...and/or to be used with Everaldo's Crystal Project icons

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8.2: Released: March 13th, 2010.

- New functionality: Add what's being streamed to a favorite list.
When listening to a track, you might think that the track
would be appropriate in a specific favorite list.
If "Now playing" is turned on, you'll have the option to add
the track currently playing to one or more favorite lists.
Besides individual tracks, this functionality also operates in relation to
performers and albums.

- New functionality: Get suggestions for favorite lists when adding.
When adding something to a favorite list, and if the option is turned on,
one or several suggestions for "appropriate" favorite lists will be shown.
Both existing and non-existing favorites.
The setting is personal.

- New functionality: Add what's being streamed to a favorite list.
...AUTOMATICALLY.
A personal setting allows tracks to be added to one or several favorite lists
automatically.
This functionality was made possible using "getTopTags" in the last.fm API.

- Improvement: Covers/performer images on the "Welcome" page.
If having f.ex. the personal setting "Browse albums by cover" turned on
as well as some kind of album content on the "Welcome" page, then album
images are displayed as images.
The same is true in relation to artists/performers.

- Improvement: Show what favorite list(s) a track is in already.
When adding a track, the favorite list(s) where the track is in already
will be shown.

- Improvement: When transcoding/downsampling is active, the actual 
names (track, tracknumber, album, performer) are used.
THANKS to dawadoc for coding this nice improvement.

- Improvement: If transcoding/downsampling is enabled+configured, it's
possible to enable transcoding/downsampling based on individual IP-addresses
and/or several ranges of IP-addresses.
This feature can come in handy, if you want to force transcoding
when someone is coming from specific IP-addresses/-ranges.
Please remember that you can also force transcoding/downsampling for 
individual users, no matter where they come from.

- Cleaned up in some of the code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8.1: Released: December 13th, 2009.

- New feature: "Scan metadata".
Addressing the apparent need to auto-download and store images of albums and
artists/performers, a new functionality - "Scan metadata" - is introduced.
It's using the Microsoft Bing API 2.0 to auto-download and store these images
makes it possible. The API requires registration with Microsoft, and the
creation of and AppID (http://www.bing.com/developers).
More information can be found in the FAQ. 

- New feature: Create AND automatically populate a favorite list with tracks.
For long-time users of AmpJuke and favorite-list afficionados, this might come
in handy.
When creating a new favorite list, you can request that the new favorite list
is created using existing tracks automatically.
This was - once again - made possible using last.fm's API (and some heavy coding
in AmpJuke, naturally).
More information can be found in the FAQ.

- Improvement: Miscrosoft Bing API 2.0 vs. album covers and performer images.
The option to replace/lookup covers and/or images for artists/performers
has been improved.
When you (or somebody else with admin acccess) click "Lookup a new image",
the API's from last.fm and Miscrosoft Bing are asked and results are displayed.
More info. can be found in the FAQ.

- Error correction: When enabling the setting 
"Re-process tracks found in database and on the filesystem" before doing a 
scan+import caused an error to be displayed.
This is no longer the case.
THANKS to enedene for nofifying about it in the forum.

- Improved: Scan+import can lookup local covers for albums on the file-system
during scan+import.
If you have album images stored in the same folder as the album tracks, then
actvating a setting can look for album images to be used+displayed later on.
THANKS to wurlitzer for nofifying about it in the forum + contributing with
some code to build upon.

- Minor improvement: The option "Keep me signed in..." on the loginpage
can be hidden.
More info. in the FAQ.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8.0: Released: 13-09-2009.

- New feature: Flash player introduced.
Having been asked for a flash player feature a while ago in the forum, it's 
(finally) implemented in AmpJuke.
The flash player relies on the XSPF Web Music Player 
(also included in the download) for the AmpJuke server, and the appropriate 
browser plugin for the users accessing/playing the music.
You can configure the use of the built-in flash player in various ways.
Note that the flash player is not supposed to replace the normal way music 
streaming works, but rather supposed to be an "add-on" to the 
streaming music engine in AmpJuke.

- Automatic cover retrieval: Ditched Amazon, now using the last.fm API.
Amazon recently made it a bit harder to fetch, download and display album 
covers automatically using the Amazon webservice.
So I switched from Amazon to the webservice provided by last.fm.
It's much easier to deal with, and - the best of all - you don't have to 
register for an API-account at Amazon (or last.fm).
Starting from this release of AmpJuke album covers are found, downloaded and 
displayed automatically - provided last.fm finds a cover.
Bear in mind you can upload your own covers as well.

- Error correction: Scan+import of music only happened in subfolders.
A rather annoying error has been corrected. 
It's related to the fact that music found in the "base_music_folder" was 
not discovered during scan+import.
F.ex. a track located here /music/track01.mp3 would not be found during 
scan+import, but /music/somefolder/track01.mp3 would.
This is no longer the case (i.e. /music/track01.mp3 will be added to the 
online music collection, provided permissions are ok).

- Error correction: "Play all..." from a specific favorite list.
Nothing started playing when clicking on "Play all..." in relation to 
any given online playlist (favorite list).
This is no longer the case.

- Optimized: Displaying images of related performers is now remarkably faster.
At least compared to earlier releases.
Furthermore, when clicking "Refresh related...", *existing* images are 
left untouched and only *new* images are retrieved, stored and displayed.

- Fixed: Only administrators are allowed to edit biographies for albums 
and artists/performers.
...at least starting from this release :)
More about automatic retrieval of biographies from albums and 
artists/performers in the corresponding FAQ-entry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7.9: Released: July 7th, 2009.

- Improvement: Browse albums by covers.
Rather than having a "plain" list of albums, it's now possible to display
album covers instead.
Cool...
Of course, the "plain" list is still available so you can switch back and forth
to use the most appropriate (personal) setting.

- Improvement: Browse performers by pictures.
Basically same type of functionality as described above.

- Improvement: Retrieving images of related performers from last.fm
is now making an attempt to get the "largesquare" (126x126px) image
of a given related performer.
If found, it will - as usual - be stored in the local cache.

- Improvement: When dispalying related performers and _not_ having
a configured number of samples displayed, the related performers
are shown in several rows rather than one related performer per row.

- Error correction: Deleting something, f.ex. a favorite list, caused a
redirect to the login-screen.
That is no longer the case.
Thanks to cowboy for notifying about it in the forum.

- New theme: Minimalistic.
An attempt to make a good theme for netbooks w. relatively small screens.

- Improvement: Rather than using sys. calls (like exec(something)), php's
own functions (like rename, move, copy) is used instead.

- Inconvenience removed: Number of related performers could in some
instances be one number higher than what was displayed.

- Made the names/title look a little better by replacing "stream.php?"
with "stream.php?/".
This only happens when "Now playing" is turned on.

- Inconvenience removed: When displaying related performers and when
"Display some tracks..." is turned on, the number of tracks from a given
related performer wasn't correct.
That is no longer the case.
More info.: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=41

- When downloading *one* track *and* without compression enabled,
nothing was downloaded.
That is no longer the case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7.8: Released: May 21st, 2009.

- More info. about related performers.
When displaying a specific performer and 'related performers' is turned
on, the part of the page with related performers now shows the number of
tracks in the database plus a configured maximum of track/samples for each 
related performer.
More information here: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=41

- Advanced search introduced.
Rather than using the simple search, it's also possible to do a more advanced
search based on several parameters.
F.ex. it's possible to search all performers starting with a specific letter
for a track, or search for all albums starting with "E" from a specific year.

- Reflections - a kewl effect...
When displaying an album image, a reflection of that image can be shown.
This is a site-wide setting that must be enabled.
More information here: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=10

- Added a new icon-set - "boomy".
This consists of some relatively large icons best suited on medium to big
sized monitors/screens.
You can also add your own, see this: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=49

- Some minor improvements here+there.
Think this is just the usual BS-statement that eveybody else adds..?
Well, try this: Display something w. page-numbers at the bottom - f.ex. a
track-list. Mouseover one of the page links. In the "help text" you'll see
the name of the entry the page starts with. Note: This doens't work for all
types of views w. pagenumbers at the bottom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7.7 Released: January 30th, 2009.

- New feature: Retrieve, store and display biographies for performers and albums.
By using the artist.getInfo and album.getInfo methods from last.fm's REST based
webservices, AmpJuke can now display a biography for any given performer/album.
If available, both short and long biographies for performers and albums 
are fetched from last.fm and then stored in the AmpJuke database.
Note: If you want a bio. to appear for albums, you'll also need to get 
your hands on an AWS-key from Amazon.
More info. in the FAQ.

- Hungarian language updated.
Thanks for Rezso for doing this.

- Improvement: If enabled, lyrics can now be obtained from a configurable
source. Previously, lyrics relied on a search engine.
The FAQ has more information.

- Improvement: Rather than displaying small images of related performers, 
AmpJuke now uses the medium sized images, if available.
It was hard enough to see anything using the (very) small images in the first
place anyway - or maybe I'm getting old :)

- Improvement: When displaying a specific performer, the various information
about that performer (bio., albums, tracks and related performers) is now
displayed in sections that can be expanded/collapsed.

- Improvement: Lockout/banning of IP-adresses can now be 
configured to be enabled/disabled. 
The setting was hardcoded previously.
If enabled, you can ban/lockout IP-addresses that have too many failed
login attempts by setting a limit that, when reached, will ban one or more
specific IP-addresses (i.e.: nobody from that IP-address will be able to
login).
The FAQ has more information.

- Corrected a major inconvenience: When displaying performers starting 
with a certain letter (f.ex. "E"), the page numbers showed links to pages 
from *all* performers or albums (f.ex. 105 pages instead of just 3).
This is no longer the case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7.6 Released: November 27th, 2008.

- Fixed a security issue in relation to displaying a specific performer.
When changing the URL "by hand", it was possible to display something
completely different.

- Error correction: Personal settings wasn't saved.
More information here: http://www.ampjuke.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=124

- Romanian language introduced.
THANKS to Nelu Campean for doing this.

- Improved installation procedure.

- Some "under the hood" modifications.
This covers a lot of improved stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7.5 Released: September 14th, 2008.

- Most important: Scan+import has been completely re-programmed.
The new scan+import offers a *lot* of settings in order to let you tweak how
to scan+import, handle missing tags, re-process files already in the database
and musc more.
The FAQ has a complete explanation of the parameters associated with
scan+import.
Thanks to wolf and kanna for suggesting a lot of relevant stuff in relation
to this in the forum.

- Fixed some security issues in relation to login.
Password is now _hashed_ in the _cookie_, 3+ failed login attempts will ban
the users IP-adress and a small delay is introduced after a login fails.
Thanks to BigBaddaBoom for suggesting this in the forum.

- Hungarian language updated.
Thanks to Rezso for doing this.

- Each section in the personal settings can now be expanded/collapsed.
This makes it much easier to jump (expand) to the part of a users 
personal settings (Login -> Settings) that he/she wish to change.
Expand/collapse is also introduced when inspecting/setting
site-wide parameters (Login -> Configuration...).

- If "Now playing" is enabled (http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=42),
the "popout" window used to show what's playing right now.
The "popout" window has been modified, so it also shows what's up next.

- With Internet Explorer 8 just around the corner, the new IE8 meta tag 
is included in the header.
The Internet Explorer 8 meta tag is set so pages are rendered as IE7 does.

- Changed slightly in the AWS (Amazon Web Service) routine.
The new method should be more efficient when fetching an album cover
automatically from Amazon.

- Images of related perfomers from last.fm are now stored _relative_ to the
folder where AmpJuke is installed.
Previously, the images was stored as an URL (http://...whatever...), which
gave problems displaying images of related performers after moving an AmpJuke 
installation from one server to another.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7.4 Released: July 17th, 2008.

- Improvement: Passwords are now md5-hashed and stored as such in the usertable.
Please note that after and upgrade, and if "remember me" is turned on 
on the loginpage, then a user is forced to login again, since passwords 
stored in cookies needs to be md5-hashed as well.
Thanks to wolf for suggesting this in the forum.

- The headline on each of the "boxes" on the 'welcome' page is now a link
to the corresponding section/view.
F.ex., if a box is used to display recently played tracks, then clicking on
the headline "Recently played tracks" will switch to the track list sorted
by tracks played recently.
Thanks to kanna for suggesting this in the forum.

- When jumping to something (f.ex. albums starting w. "K"), it's now also
possible to jump to something (tracks, albums, performers) that starts
with a digit (0..9).
Thanks to anil_mndl for suggesting this in the forum.

- Minor improvement: The utility for editing the data in the database
has been improved slightly.
More information here: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=35

- Minor improvement: The functionality for showing/hiding the upload option 
is now the same as the functionality related to download.
Basically it's not necessary to login again to see the upload option.
More here: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=23
and (related to configuration), here: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=37
and here: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=24

- Search also accepts spaces.

- Username and -password in the last.fm section in the personal settings
accepts more characters.
Thanks to kanna for a reminder about this in the forum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7.3 Released: May 22nd, 2008.

- Support for M4a, MP4 etc. ('special extensions')...sort of.
A new setting called 'special extensions' is introduced to handle this.
The goal is specifically to enable support for the popular m4a format.
However, mp4, wma and possible other formats as well might be supported...
There are some limitations when using something like m4a-files in AmpJuke.
This FAQ-entry has all the (important) details: 
http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=54

- New (cool) functionality: When moving the mouse over something that has an 
image available, f.ex. an album name, AmpJuke will display that image.
This is done using a simple, pure CSS popup image viewer.
If you have an AWS key, you can use this functionality to "flip through"
your albums (images) by just hovering over the link of the album, and then an
image will automatically popup as long as the mouse is over the link.
This is - of course - a personal setting, so it can be turned on/off 
according to each user's personal preference/taste.
Check out the FAQ at: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=53

- New theme: "Matrix", done by cowboy. THANKS !
There are now 17 different themes available to choose from in AmpJuke.
Feel free to add your own.

- New icons: "Circular" (16x16 .png format) has been added.
There are now 7 different icon sets to choose from in AmpJuke.
Feel free to add your own.

- Fixed an error in upload that enabled upload of music _outside_ the
'base' folder used to music.
This meant that an upload could enter something like '../../otherfolder'
as the destination folder...
THANKS to don for notifying about this.

- Fixed a small error in relation to "jump to <letter>".

- Optimized for speed. 
Compared to earlier releases, this version of AmpJuke has improved in
terms of page load times. The 'price' to pay is increased memory consumption.

- One of the security issues fixed in the previous version meant that
anonymous users couldn't get access (provided AmpJuke allows anonymous access).
This is no longer the case.

- Corrected a minor inconvenience in relation to displaying what's up next:
When the last track in the playlist was being streamed, the "next playing"
section showed "Random tracks".
This is no longer the case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7.2 Released: April 4th, 2008.

- The last.fm functionality in AmpJuke has been expanded.
Besides displaying and streaming tracks based on related performers, it's
also possible to submit tracks to a user-profile on last.fm.
The FAQ has more information about configuration and how to use this
new functionality.

- When displaying what being played currently, AmpJuke also displays
the name of the _next_ track to be streamed (or just "Random play" of you're at
the end of the playlist).
This is only displayed in the "Now playing" section (not in the "pop out"), and
only of your media-player isn't in the "light update" list.
See this FAQ for usage+configuration of 
the "Now playing" feature: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=42

- New icons: "Pi Diagona" (10x10 .png format) has been added.

- Added a check to see if all pictures are locally available when displaying
related performers (as in: performers related to the performer displayed
currently).
If not, refresh related performers (incl. pictures) from last.fm.

- More security issues fixed. Basically checking URL-parameters 'n' stuff.

- Added an unobtrusive donation button. Only for administrators...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7.1 Released: February 14th, 2008.

- New feature introduced to speed up scanning: "Cutoff" date.
If/when set to a date in the past, AmpJuke will only look for+add tracks
that have been modified after that date.
By setting a "cutoff" date, scan+import will happen a *lot* faster, compared 
to previous functionality (scan everything, everytime).
The FAQ has more information about the tweaks+settings in relation to this.

- A (cool?) new feature: AmpJuke can stream music based on related performers.
Basically last.fm functionality is used to pick related performers in AmpJuke.
Just like last.fm, AmpJuke selects a random track based on a performer 
that's "related" to the most recently played performer.
F.ex. if your last selection was Erasure, then AmpJuke will most likely 
pick the next track from a related performer, such as Pet Shop Boys,
Yazoo, Duran Duran, Eurythmics etc. (provided either one is a part of your 
music collection).
This is a personal setting, - the FAQ has more information.

- When searching, some XSS-vulnerabilities have been reported elsewhere.
XSS is (_should_) no longer (be) possible.

- New theme: "Kutzaray's Cool Theme".
Thanks to kutzaray , it really is...cool.

- Running a scan+import now shows how many seconds that scan took.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7.0 Released: January 16th, 2008.

- Transcoding (downsampling) of music introduced.
You can set transcoding to a lower bitrate (f.ex. 96kbit/sec) 
when users stream tracks.
Transcoding happens on-the-fly (in realtime) and can be quite heavy on the CPU.
Enable/disable this feature just like most other settings ("Now playing",
allow anonymous access etc.).

- Icons !
A new personal setting means you can combine icons with themes.
For starters, FOUR icon sets have been included in this release of AmpJuke.
If you still want 'old' behaviour, you can select "no icons" in your personal
setting, and the usual "arrow" is displayed in various places.

- Hungarian language updated.
THANKS to Rezso for doing this.

- Estonian language updated.
THANKS to kanna for doing this in the forum.

- The earlier reported error about the "disappearance" of the configured
prefix for tables does no longer exist.
THANKS to chs for notifying about this in the forum.

- Refreshing related performers from last.fm happens automatically.
If "Related performers" is enabled, then a query will be made against last.fm 
in order to retrieve an updated list of related performers.
This only happens if the cached list of related performers isn't available.
It's still possible for administrators to make the query manually.

- The graphics displayed on the login and 'welcome' page have changed.
They more or less are 'web 2.0 style' now - or at least SUPPOSED to look like
that :-)

- Corrected some minor inconveniences related to displaying stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.7. Released: December 15th, 2007.

- New feature: Prefix for tablenames.
During installation it's possible to specify a prefix for all tablenames.
This is especially useful if you use a server that only allows one MySQL
database, but you might run many different applications that each require
access to MySQL.
Default prefix is "ampjuke_", which will be added in front of all 
tablenames used.
If you want to use prefixes, please note that it will have an impact
on performance, since each and every SQL-statement will have to be inspected,
and possibly modified, before execution.
Note that prefixes is new functionality - I've done my best to test - *if*
you run into trouble in relation to this, please post whatever problem
exists in relation to prefixes in the forum.

- New feature: Refresh related performers.
Added an option (for users with administrator access) to refresh/update
related performer(s) from last.fm, when displaying a given performer/group.

- Error correction: File(s) left in ./tmp was not removed automatically after
24 hours.
This is no longer the case.

- Improvement: A warning is issued, if you try to install AmpJuke using 
a PHP-version less than 5.
Although it *MIGHT* work, it's still recommended to run at least PHP 5.x.x.

- Improvement: When displaying a list that spans across several pages, there's
now a link that jumps to the 1st/last page of the list in question.
Basically an improvement when displaying paginated lists.

- Improvement: Tables are now, by default, created using the MyISAM storage 
engine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.6. Released: November 6th, 2007.

- Cleaned up + improved the entire streaming process.
The earlier introduction of "Now playing" apparently caused a lot of trouble
"out there". I'm sorry about that, since streaming is such a vital part of
AmpJuke.
Anyway, streaming should work without any flaws from now on.
...and I PROMISE I won't modify this part (not in the next couple of releases).

- Improved the code that retrieves album covers using the Amazon web service.
Besides a significant reduction (33%) in the number of lines to handle this,
combined with a more speedy cover-retrievel, the code also relies 
completely on PHP5.

- Corrected an error in relation to replacing an Amazon cover by either a
"blank" cover and/or by looking up a new cover at Amazon.
Thanks to kutzaray for notifying about this in the forum.

- New personal setting: Avoid duplicate entries.
When enabled (checked), AmpJuke will not add a given track to a given
favorite list, if the track is already present in the list.
More information about this can be found in the FAQ.

- Minor improvements here+there.
Such as: Added link to "Play/enqueue all..." when displaying a specific
performer, added more links to the AmpJuke FAQ.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.5. Released: October 14th, 2007.

- Corrected an annoying (but important) detail:
When using Microsoft Windows Media Player and having "Now playing" set to "on", 
it turned out that there was problems showing the name of the track that
is playing in WMP.
This has been corrected. 
More information in this FAQ: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=44
I must admit WMP is not a favorite of mine...
Thanks to kutzaray for reporting about this in the forum.

- Corrected an error that appeared during upgrade.
Thanks to wolf for notifying about this in the forum.

- Spanish translation complete.
Besides being available in the download, it's also available in the forum.
Thanks to kutzaray for doing this.

- Covers for albums are now stored using "album_id.jpg".
It used to be "performer name - album name.jpg", which caused problems when
displaying certain albums, - f.ex. if an album has a "&" in the name.
Thanks to kutzaray for suggesting this in the forum.
By the way: In case you have album covers stored from an older version 
(<0.6.5), AmpJuke attempts to make the name transition automatically 
each time an album is displayed.

- "Help" links points to the AmpJuke FAQ.
This is a personal setting. It can be turned on/off.
When turned on, a small question mark appears next to various menus and
configuration options within AmpJuke.
If the user clicks on a question mark, an attempt to open a new window
with the relevant FAQ is made.
The number of help topics (FAQ -> "Using AmpJuke") will increase in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.4. Released: October 10th, 2007.

- New feature: "Now playing".
Like most other configurable stuff in AmpJuke, this feature operates on 
two levels:
Administrators can turn this feature on/off completely for the installation, 
and individual users can turn it on/off as well (provided it's enabled for 
the installation).
There's also an option for displaying what's currently being played in a small
"popout" box.
This is a very, very cool feature ! (At least I pretend it to be cool and 
unique, so please let me continue to believe that...lol)

- New language: Estonian.
Thanks to Kalmer Kand for this nice contribution.

- New setting: Allow anonymous users to browse only.
When configuring AmpJuke (during installation and/or later), there's an
option to allow anonymous users (users wo. login+password) to get access.
With this new setting, you can allow 'anonymous' users to only browse
music (not stream it).
Thanks to viciouslime for suggesting this in the forum.

- New theme: "Back to school". 
Purpose: To look like something scribbled by hand on the big board at school.
It's available in two flavors: Blackboard and Whiteboard.
Depending on your age, either one might bring back memories from your time
in school.
The "Back to school" theme relies on certain fonts that must be on your system.

- The './tmp' folder is no longer included in downloaded music.
Thanks to wolf for asking for this improvement in the forum.

- A MySQL-error was displayed when a performer with no tracks/albums was
being deleted, causing the deletion to fail.
This is no longer the case.
Thanks to kutzaray for notification about this in the forum.

- Songs with "#" in the filename could not be streamed.
This has been corrected by introducing a configurable setting 
called "forbidden" characters (like o-umalut, "#" and so on).
Thanks to kutzaray for notification about this in the forum.

- Error correction in download.
An error causing tracks with "special" characters (like o-umlaut) not to be
downloaded has been corrected (see previous topic).
Thanks to wolf for notification about this in the forum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.3. Released: August 31st, 2007.

- Change the 'welcome' page.
This is a personal setting, so each user can pick what's displayed on
the 'welcome' page to suit his/her own taste.

- Remember login+password on the computer you're using.
Just like other sites (f.ex. Google, Yahoo!), you can stay logged in 
between sessions.
This is done by checking the "Keep me signed in" on the login-page.

- When running a scan+import of new/updated music and if the 'Delete "dead"
records' have been checked, the deletion of "dead" records in the database
now happens BEFORE new/updated music is discovered.
Thanks to wolf for notification about this in the forum.

- Upload a cover: If the Amazon webservice doesn't find a suitable cover
and you don't want to use a blank cover for a particular album, you can
now - as a third option - upload a cover.
Covers will always be stored in the "covers" folder.
Furthermore, covers (still) must be .jpg-files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.2. Released: August 1st, 2007.

- Changed the folder-name that contains graphics.
The new name is "ampjukeicons" (was previously: "icons").
Apparently, the name "icons" got mixed up with Apache's own "icons" folder
on some installations.
Thanks to Kevin for the notification about this.

- Corrected an inconvenience on the 'welcome' page (not related to the above).

- French and Turkish languages updated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.1. Released: July 26th, 2007.

- New personal setting: Display related performers.
If turned on and when displaying a performer, AmpJuke makes a query against
the popular last.fm site/community, and retrieve a list of related performers.
This is done using a webservice from last.fm.
If a related performer in the last.fm list is also found the AmpJuke database, 
a link (+ picture!) is displayed for each performer.
This makes it possible to jump around related performers within AmpJuke.
You dont need an access-key or anything to use this functionality - its 
simply built into AmpJuke.
However, for this to work, you *must* use PHP version 5.

- The Amazon web service is now upgraded to use Amazon's ECS 4.0.
Furthermore, AmpJuke now tries to find a suitable cover on three different
Amazon sites: USA, UK and Germany (was only trying the USA site earlier).
Please see this FAQ for more details: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=10

- Upload feature introduced.
It's possible to enable individual users to upload music on a track-by-track
basis. Upload can be turned completely off as well on the configuration page.
This a FAQ-entry explains the configuration options:
http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=37

- The SQL-code used for displaying an album list as well as displaying an
individual album has been modified.
THANKS to Stuart Hardy for suggesting+implementing the code for this.
You can - by the way - find Stuarts homepage here: http://stuart-h.homeip.net/

- "Deutch" corrected to "Deutsch" in Settings -> Other options -> Language.
My deepest apologies to the German users for this typo.
...and THANKS to Andreas B. for notifying about this (obvious) error.

- New theme: "AB Centered Terracotta".
Once again: THANKS to Andreas B. (http://andreasburg.de).
It's really cool (um...rather: red - but still cool), isn't it ??

- Improved installation as well as scan+import of music. 
Checks are made here+there to ensure a smooth installation (and scan+import).
However, you're still more than welcome to see (and follow) a step-by-step
installation example. Just point your browser to:
http://www.ampjuke.org/install_ex.php

- Before actual scan+import begins, a check is made against the
folder(s) that contains music tracks on the filesystem, to make sure that
the web-user has permissions to access the folder(s).

- Corrected an error in relation to scan+import of mp3-files with ID3v1-tags:
The track number was not discovered+imported. It is now.

- Corrected a stupid error (wrong speling....) that prevented .wma-files
from being recognized as music (and thus couldn't be scanned+imported).
THANKS to Claes-Henrik for pointing me in the right direction.
Please note that your preferred musicplayer might not be able to play
.wma-files (I had some issues with XMMS), so please dont blame AmpJuke.

- Remember settings in random play.
The settings for "Play tracks from", "Number of tracks..." and 
"Give priority to..." are remembered.
This is done using the lazy approach: cookies, - so the settings will 
only be remembered/stored locally (on the computer).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.0. Released: June 6th, 2007.

- A beefed-up scan-routine. Scan+import music is easier now.
New music is discovered automatically.

- Added an option to 'clean-up' in the database during scan+import.
If selected, the "dead" records (a record that points to a file on the
filesystem that's no longer there is "dead") will be deleted from the database.

- Improved download functionality.
When downloading more than one track (f.ex. an album), all tracks are
compressed into one file, which is sent for download afterwards.
I know compression doesn't make much sense in relation to stuff that's
already compressed (which is the case with the mp3 music format), but
hey: at least you're no longer prompted several times when downloading
more than one track...

- Added options to play/enqueue/download an entire album, all tracks 
by a specific performer, year, favorite list etc. in the 'overview'.

- Updated languages: German/Deutch (THANKS Andreas!), Español, Francais, 
Dutch, Portuguese and Turkish.
THANKS to all who took the time+effort to do this ! (but please
enter your email address next time, so I can ask to link to your
homepage).

- New theme: Highlighter.
You know: just like the "greasy" pen you're using to - well - highlight 
something within a text...squeak...squeak... :-)

- Corrected an error:
When having 'Confirm deletions' set to 'on' in the personal settings,
it was _not_ possible to delete an entry in a given favorite list (error msg.).
When 'Confirm deletions' was set to 'off', no error messages appeared, and
the item was removed from the favoritelist in question.

- Corrected (another) error in relation to fetching/displaying lyrics.
This time it should be right....hopefully....sort of....

- More descriptive title displayed in the title bar of the browser.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.5.5. Released: April 7th, 2007.

- New feature: AmpJuke can be set to ask what favoritelist you want to add
something (tracks,albums,performers,years) to.
This is a personal setting, meaning each user can set it to whatever is 
wanted.
Of course, it's still possible to do as usual: 
create/select a favoritelist and then add something (tracks,albums...).

- Hungarian language updated. 
THANKS to Rezso (http://www.rezso.net/) for doing this.

- Spanish language updated. THANKS to Claudio for doing this.

- Corrected an error in relation to displaying/fetching the lyrics.
It seemed like the URL was not properly formatted. THANKS to Steven for
reporting this.

- It's now possible to download individual tracks from a favorite list.
THANKS to David for asking for this (obvious) feature.

- When creating a new favorite list, the new list is no longer selected
by default.

- Cleaned up the code eliminating some redundancy (f.ex. removing same 
sequence of PHP-statements used in a lot of different places so they from
now on only is found in one place).

- New theme: Empty ("Do not apply any CSS"). Really simple :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.5.4. Released: 13-03-2007.

- Dutch language up-to-date.
THANKS to Fokke Slottje (http://www.twilightmusic.nl/) for doing this!

- Incrementing the value of 'times played' by one for a given track, is from 
now on done *AFTER* the track has been streamed.

- Annoying error corrected:
If a user specified *NOT* to display 'number of times played' it turned
out that the date of 'last played' was hidden instead (and the opposite).
This is no longer the case.

- Error correction: When copying the queue to a specific favorite list,
nothing was copied.
This is no longer the case.

- New theme: Typewriter.
Remember when you had to use a typewriter with a two-colored ribbon-band ??
This theme brings back the (good old) memories...
If not, here's what your father might have had to deal with in his young years!

- Cleaned up minor display inconveniences here&there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.5.3. Released: February 20th, 2007.

- A new setting in relation to random play:
You can optionally let the random selection appear based on one of five criterias:
  - No criteria (completely random -> do as usual).
  - Least played tracks.
  - Most played tracks.
  - Tracks not played recently.
  - Tracks played recently.
...obviously, this means you can now have a kind of "fair" rotation of tracks 
in any favorite list.

- Corrected an error in relation to updating 'last-played' in 
random play->All tracks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.5.2. Released: February 13th, 2007.

- Improvement: Displaying favorites is now a factor 10 (at least) faster, 
depending on the number/size of favorite lists you have.
This 'slow' behaviour (with many/huge favorite lists) has been a personal 
pain for me for quite some time...

- Swedish language updated (a long time ago in fact...THANKS, Jorgen).

- Hungarian language updated (THANKS, Rezso, www.rezso.net).

- New feature: You can share your favorites with other AmpJuke users.
A new column is displayed in the "favorites" view: Shared.
Below is an indication showing if the favoritelist is shared or 
not (Yes/No) as well as a number indicating how many other users 
have access to the favorite list in question.
Each user can set the display of shared favorites to on/off in 
his/her personal settings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.5.1. Released: January 19th, 2007.

- Error correction: When using "jukebox mode" (see prev. release) and
setting AmpJuke to play music by random from a specific favorite list,
a selection was made against an 'old' table (pre. 0.5.x-series) of
favorites.
This is no longer the case.

- Modification: Since the release of 0.5.0, I received some reports
about Ubuntu (especially) complaining about "headers already sent...".
As a consequence, the stream method has now - more or less - been
'rolled back' to reflect the functionality found in 0.4.4.

- Get external, extended information about a performer displayed.
By using f.ex. the popular Wikipedia, you can display detailed information
about any performer/group in your database.
Youre not limited to Wikipedia, use whatever external site as reference.
Please see the FAQ (http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php) for further details.

- Portuguese language 100% updated. Thanks to Alfredo Oliveira for taking
the time to do this using the new translation feature 
(found at http://www.ampjuke.org/xlate/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.5.0. Released: December 31st, 2006.

- New feature: Favorites can now be sorted/played by whatever your selection 
is. F.ex. year, duration, times played etc.
F.ex. if you lookup and album, sort it by duration and then click on
'play all tracks...', the music will be played based on the sorting
criteria you selected.

- New personal setting: AmpJuke can stream music *AFTER* the last track has 
been streamed ("jukebox mode").

- New theme: "Polonium-210". A "radioactive" (lethal?) appearance of AmpJuke.
Thanks to Dave (who kindly asked not to have full name + webiste mentioned)
for this !

- The words "day" and "days" were not translated.
Note: If your preferred language is something different than English, you
must translate these words yourself.
Take a look at: http://www.ampjuke.org/faq.php?q_id=8

- Date (+time, optionally) of last login is now displayed (was earlier 
displaying "Unix-time" -> seconds since 01-01-70).

- Got rid of the last header(...)-statements. 
Replaced with redirects based on JavaScript...
Hopefully, NOBODY will ever get the "headers allready sent" error anymore.
Thanks to Johan Corstjens for reporting this !

- Some empty columns here+there have been eliminated -> improved layout.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.4.4. Released: October 19th, 2006.

- New method for playing/streaming music.
Instead of copying music to the 'tmp' directory and then play/stream,
the program now streams music directly from where they are stored.
Thanks to Allan Hansen from the getID3 project (http://getid3.sourgeforge.net)
for suggesting this as well as suppplying a couple of lines of code I could
use for implementing this.

- The 'demos' directory under the 'getid3' directory have been removed.
Thanks (again) to Allan for mentioning that the scripts in the directory
could be used by anybody to explore whatever is available
on the local harddrive.

- Hungarian languagefile was updated.
Thanks to Reszo (http://www.reszo.net) for doing this.

- The settings for 'Directory to place music temporarily' as well
as the setting 'Delete files in tmp directory after X hours' have
been removed (as a consequence of the new streaming method introduced).

Minor stuff:
- Last search word(s) is (are) remembered.
- Date+time on the 'welcome' page now uses the correct date (Thanks, Rezso).
- More use of JavaScript instead of header("Location...") for redirects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.4.3. Released: October 4th, 2006.

- THEMES ! (finally)
By far the most important in the release: It's now possible to change 
the layout of AmpJuke.
This has been on the list for quite a while, and a *lot* of you out there
have asked for this feature.
I've included 4 themes (one is for different screen resolutions).

- References are made to relevant FAQ-entries on the AmpJuke homepage 
during installation. 
This should hopefully help...

- When pointing the browser to the directory where AmpJuke 
is installed, a check is made to see if you want to upgrade or install.

- Corrected some small errors found here+there (not a big deal).

- Corrected another small error in relation to displaying lyrics.
Grab+display of lyrics should work as expected now...hmmm...hope so at least...

- New logo's have been introduced in this version of AmpJuke.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.4.2. Released: September 6th, 2006.

A "maintenance" release, adding one new feature as well as 
adressing some minor inconveniences:

- You can keep extensions (mp3/ogg/wma/ape/whatever) when streaming music.
By setting this to 'on' music files will be streamed as:
"performer - track.extension" (extension could f.ex. be: mp3).
By setting this to 'off' music files will be streamed as:
"performer - track".
See the difference ?

- When creating a new user, the selected language is stored (was set to EN
by default earlier).

- When searching for lyrics, the first result (URL) from the 
search at Yahoo! is displayed (wasn't sure that was the case earlier).

- Deletion of individual tracks/album/year/performer also deletes
the references to the track/album/year/performer from users favorites lists.
The data is only deleted from the database - no musicfiles will be deleted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.4.1. Released: July 25th, 2006.

- Error correction: When reading .ogg-files, nothing was imported.
This has been fixed.

- A file called 'template.php' now exists in the 'lang' directory.
It contains all keywords/phrases you will need to translate to your
own language, in order to get a 'local' version of AmpJuke.
If you could take the time and e-mail me a copy of whatever language you have
translated to, I (and possibly everybody else) would be happy.
Include your homepage, if you want me to link to it.
Thanks to Rezso for suggesting and implementing this.

- Some minor inconveniencies have been eliminated. 
Once again: Thanks to Rezso for pointing this out.

You might only wanto to upgrade to this verson if you're having trouble with
importing ogg-files...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.4.0. Released: July 21st, 2006.

- Get lyrics (optionally). 
You can search for and display lyrics for any track within your database. 
If found, the lyrics will show up in a seperate window.
So from now on you have absolutely no excuse for not singing along !!  :-)

- New language introduced: Hungarian (Magyar). THANKS to Reszo !

- Error corrected in the module that displays page numbers (div. by zero).
Once again: THANKS to Reszo (even though I never encountered the
problem myself...).

- The Amazon Web Service is now (at least) a factor 10 faster.
The code has been rewritten completely.

- Remember username and/or password (optionally).
You can make AmpJuke remember the last used username and/or password on
the computer(s) you're using with AmpJuke.
I know this is a feature of (most?) browsers, but it's available anyway.
It's based on standard cookie-stuff, so it will not work if your 
browser does not allow cookies.

- Various minor inconsistencies corrected, such as:
no more PHP-scripts using <? in the beginning (now it's: <?php), added
"missing" <TH>'s etc..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3.7. Released: July 10th, 2006.

- Allow "anonymous" users to login (no username+password required).
Obviously, "anonymous" users cannot create favorite lists, change 
settings etc.
In fact, "anonymous" users are rather limited when it comes to 
changing stuff...
This functionality was implemented as a result of several requests.
You set/change this in the "Configuration" menu, and/or when you install.
Please note that allowing this might cause trouble in relation to
the record industry...should they ever find out you're allowing anonymous
users to listen to your music :-)

- When displaying the "welcome page" (1st page after successfull login),
The 10 most recently tracks played will be shown below the other two
"last played..." tables.

- If ID-numbers are displayed (optionally), albums will be 
sorted descending when entering the album view. 
If not, sorting will be based on album name.

- Error correction: When the duration of a specific favorite list exceeded
one day (24 hours), the days wasn't calculated. That is no longer the case.
If a favorite list exceeds one day, it will be displayed as: 
"x day(s) hh:mm:ss" (x=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes, ss=seconds).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3.6. Released: May 8th, 2006.

- No attempt is made to lookup cover/album art on amazon.com, if the
AWS-key (Amazon Webservices Key) has  not been entered/set.

- Download option. A user with the appropriate access level can download
individual traks, entire albums, search results etc.

- Automatic play. Just after a successfull login, it is possible to
have AmpJuke play tracks based on "all tracks" or a favorite list.

- Translation to French. THANKS TO Edwin ! (www.allan.ch)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3.5. Released: March 30th, 2006.

- AmpJuke has been translated to Dutch.
It's included in the distribution.

- Users can set "confirm deletion" (or not).
If set, an "...are you sure ?" message is displayed everytime before
deletion of favorite lists, tracks, albums, the queue etc.etc. is done.

- Users can specify if they want the duration on _individual_ tracks
displayed (or not).

- Users can specify if they want to "display totals" (or not).
This might require a little explanation...
If selected, the following will be displayed in addition to what was there
before:
1. Displaying an album: # of tracks, total duration and times played
will be added at the bottom of the list.
2. Displaying a list of performers: A new column will appear showing total
duration for all tracks/albums.
3. Displaying a list of albums: Two news columns will appear showing
total number of tracks and total duration.
4. Displaying favorite lists: A new column will appear showing duration
for all tracks within the favorite list.
...these additional informations are only available then "Display totals"
is checked in "Settings".

- It is now more clear/evident what the active/selected favorite list is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3.4. Released: March 9th, 2006.

- AmpJuke has been translated to Italian.
It's included in the distribution.

- Settings for "Show ID numbers" and "Show letters (jump to)" are now
stored/remembered between sessions/logins.

- Users can optionally change password under "Personal settings".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3.3. Released: November 22nd, 2005.

- You can FILTER the tracks displayed in "Tracks" and "Search", so it is
possible to see one of the following:
        1. All tracks (no filter). This is default/normal.
        2. Tracks only on albums.
        3. Tracks not on any album.

- When stepping back to a previous page that contained a search-result,
the browser would normally warn about the fact that data should be POST'ed
again. This is normal behaviour, but annoying.
The inconvenience is fixed in this release.
        
- AmpJuke has been translated to Turkish.
It's included in the distribution.

- Minor improvements.
Really not worth to write about, but I just did anyway :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3.2. Released: November 7th, 2005.

- Option to remove duplicate entries from the queue as well as any favorite
list.

- Option to avoid playing same track twice when selecting random tracks.

- All translated languages so far are now a part of the release.

- Minor inconveniencies removed/fixed:
    - No translation of "The queue" when setting up random play (fixed).
    - Various tablerows no longer needed (removed).
    - "Missing" translations (fixed).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3.1. Released: October 17th 2005.

- Besides MP3-music files, AmpJuke can now read/import
music on these formats: WMA, OGG and APE.

- Bugfix: It is now possible for administrators to change language on 
behalf of other users (Thanks, Jorgen).

- When importing music, AmpJuke may display a number of warnings found
during import of a certain directory.
Until now, it was not possible to investigate what causes these warnings.
With the introduction of this release, the user can now click on a link and
see exactly what it is that produces these warnings.
A warning may be issued because of lack of "non-critical" information, such as
no year or no album found within the tags.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3.0. Released: October 8th 2005.

- Album and Performer/Group covers ("album art") is displayed.
This is basically done using a webservice from Amazon.
You will need to register with "Amazon Web Services (AWS)" to get an
"Amazon Developer Key".
Check in on www.ampjuke.org for details.

- AmpJuke has been translated to ONE language (apart from english): Danish.
However, the only thing that remains in order to have more languages is YOUR
HELP.

- AmpJuke can be set to automatically clear files from the 'tmp' dir.
This setting is controlled from the "Configuration" link under
"Admin's options".

- It is now possible to UPGRADE an AmpJuke installation without overwriting
previous configuration values/settings.
Just extract the files in the distribution to your ampjuke directory and
point your browser to http://"whatever"/install.php.
This procedure should be done also if you're INSTALLING for the 1st time.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.2.5. Released: September 19th, 2005.

- A warning is issued during installation stating the user "admin" should 
change the default password immediately after installation.

- The program only scans files with an extension of "mp3". 
All other types of files (f.ex.: "m3u", "asx", "wma" and so on) found within
the music directory and below are skipped.

- The AmpJuke version number is displayed in the lower right corner.
Please do not remove it. It's a fair "price" to pay to use the program...
Besides, it's a link to www.ampjuke.org, so you can check in later to look
for updates/new releases.

- New logos, again. Hope you like them :-)
Thanks to Jorgen for the logos, and thanks to Everaldo for supplying the
loudspeaker ! In case you like the old logos they're still included in the
"icons" directory. Just rename "ampjuke176x62_old.jpg" to "ampjuke176x62.jpg"
and "ampjuke88x31_old.jpg" to "ampjuke88x31.jpg" and they'll be back.
There is also "ampjuke88x31_alt.jpg" and "ampjuke176x62_alt.jpg" if you want to
experiment a little :-]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.2.4. Released: September 2005.
- "[Add to favorite]" was still displayed in some views, even though no favorite
list was selected/created. This error also existed in previous versions.
This should no longer be the case starting from this version...hopefully :-)

- It is now possible to rescan all or parts of the music directly from 
"Admin's options" (menu in the lower left of the screen).

- When installing AmpJuke, the options: "Create an empty database" as well as
Create empty tables within the database" are now UNCHECKED. 
Take care to CHECK the options FIRST time you install the program.

- The function for calculating the size of the cache (the sum of files within
the 'tmp' directory) has been rewritten.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.2.3. Released: September 2005.

New features / changes:
- Logos. 
New logos (2 pcs.) are introduced. Hope you like them :-)

- Performer.
The view now shows two additional columns: "Number of tracks" and 
"Number of albums".
"Number of albums" just shows the albums where the performer displayed is the 
only performer on that album, - ie. "Also appears on" does not count in 
this column.

- Settings.
Settings now controls more options. 
This includes the "Display ID's" and the "Show letters" settings. 
Basically, all display settings are controlled within "Settings".

- Edit/delete/transfer. 
Editing is implemented in this release. It's a BETA, so be CAREFUL !
To edit something (tracks, albums, performers), the "Display ID's" must 
be turned on (see previous topic), since editing is something you 
do by clicking on the ID for the item in question.
The option to delete something (tracks, albums, performers) is 
accessed in the same way. It is also possible to "transfer" something. 
F.ex. all tracks from one album can be transferred to another album and/or 
all tracks with one performer can be transferred to another (useful when 
spelling errors exists in the mp3-files' ID-tags).



Error corrections / fixes:
- User administration: Several bugs was fixed.

- "[Add to favorite]" was displayed even though no favorite 
list was created/selected.

- Performer: When entering the performer list, the performers appeard 
to be sorted alphabetically. That was not the case. 
(Thanks to Robert for reporting this).
