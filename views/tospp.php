<p><br />
</p>

<p>Music (yours as well as others’) will be made available on three platforms, all of which shall be freely distributed: download, streaming and radio.</p>

<p><br />

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Glipple does not and will not earn, receive or be entitled to financial compensation of any kind from you, for and/or resulting from any radio play on or over Glipple’s radio service and/or by or through Glipple’s Platform, other than payment/compensation from or resulting from advertising and/or from payment or compensation from parties other than you; provided however, that Glipple will not solicit or accept “payola”, as is set forth in more detail in section 5.2(l) immediately following.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>You may revoke this license at any time by deleting your Glipple profile and/or by deleting/removing our material/music from the Glipple Platform. You understand that you will retain all creative and legal rights over said musical material throughout and thereafter.</p>

You are solely responsible for any User Content you provide and for any consequences thereof. You represent that you have the right to post any User Content which you post to the Platform, and that such User Content, or its use by us as contemplated by this Agreement, does not: (a) violate these Agreements, applicable law, or the intellectual property or publicity rights of others; or (b) imply any affiliation, endorsement, approval or cooperation with you or your User Content by Glipple or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from such individual or entity. You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any User Content that you post on or in connection with Glipple.

Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, if you, as an Artist, have uploaded music files to the Glipple Platform, you may revoke this license at any time by removing or deleting such music files and your profile or Artist information from the Platform; provided however, that such revocation shall not be retroactive, so that any music files that have been downloaded and/or transferred by end users (“Fans” or “Listeners”) prior to such revocation, and any music files that have been transferred by end users even after such revocation with respect to music files that were downloaded prior to such revocation, shall not entitle you to any royalties or other form of compensation.

</qowt-section></qowt-page><qowt-page named-flow="FLOW-1" ><qowt-section named-flow="FLOW-2" qowt-eid="E237" ><p>16. Choice of Law, Mandatory Arbitration and Venue</p>

<p>Unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union, Canada, or any other jurisdiction, these Agreements are subject to the law of the State of Georgia, United States, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and Glipple agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Fulton County, Georgia to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy that arises in connection with these Agreements.</p>

<p>If you are a United States user, the following mandatory arbitration provisions also apply to you:</p>

<p>You and Glipple agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Glipple Platform or your use thereof, including our Agreements, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Glipple are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Agreements and the termination of your Glipple account. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by these Agreements, and as administered by the AAA. You and Glipple agree that these Agreements involve interstate commerce and are subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>

<p>You and Glipple agree that (a) any claims seeking to enforce, protect, or determine the validity or ownership of any intellectual property rights, and (b) any claims related to allegations of theft, piracy or unauthorized use of the Glipple Platform are NOT subject to mandatory arbitration. Instead, you and Glipple agree that these claims (including but not limited to claims for injunctive or equitable relief) shall be exclusively decided by state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Fulton County, Georgia, and that applicable Georgia and/or Federal law shall govern, without regard to choice of law principles.</p>

<p>YOU AND GLIPPLE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING. Further, no arbitrator shall consolidate any other person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any way, then the entirety of this arbitration section shall be null and void. The arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief.</p>

<p>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules with the remainder paid by Glipple. Any arbitration costs or fees deemed “excessive” will be paid by Glipple.</p>

<p>17. Entire Agreement</p>

<p>These Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Glipple and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral. Any additional or different terms or conditions in relation to the subject matter of the Agreements in any written or oral communication from you to Glipple are void. You represent that you have not accepted the Agreements in reliance on any oral or written representations made by Glipple that are not contained in the Agreements. Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the Glipple Platform may be governed by additional agreements. That could include, for example, access to the Glipple Community for customer support, access to the Glipple Platform as a result of promotional extensions, etc. You may agree to separate terms and conditions in those circumstances, which will be made available at such time that said alternative terms and conditions may apply. Those terms and conditions shall govern only with regard to the aspect of the Platform to which they apply, and are distinct from and supplemental to these Agreements, and do not supersede these Agreements. To the extent that there is any conflict between those agreements and these Agreements, these Agreements shall control, except as otherwise provided in these Terms. Occasionally we may offer you the chance to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and surveys (“Special Promotions”) through the Service. Special Promotions may be governed by terms and conditions that are separate from these Terms. If the provisions of a Special Promotion’s terms and conditions conflict with these Terms, those separate terms and conditions shall prevail.</p>

<p>18. Severability</p>

<p>Should any provision of the Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Terms, and </p>

</qowt-section></qowt-page><qowt-page named-flow="FLOW-1" ><qowt-section named-flow="FLOW-2" qowt-eid="E237" ><p>the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>
